Over recent months I've become incredibly frustrated with the limited capabilities that the MS Office suite provides. While every tool for data viz has it's place, I've made it my mission to learn and eventually harness the power of modern charting frameworks, such as the beautiful d3.js platform, created by the insanely talented Mike Bostock at the New York Times.

I'll be using this blog as a testbed for learning, understanding and playing with tools such as d3. This can be considered a virtual playground for collecting my thoughts. Of course there are also practical reasons for this, for reasons I won't bore you with, using datasets requires a server and my intention is to use real public datasets in these data visuals.

##First steps


Switching back to markdown. While interesting as this is, it still leaves me very far away from those beautiful charts.

At the top of this post is some random data, placed into a bar chart. Refresh the page, and the data will change. And thus concludes my first foray into d3.js.
